# Source Control Automation

The orchestration pipeline's source control automation feature enables automatic git commit and push after every approved task. It is configured via `orchestration.yml` using an `always | ask | never` convention that applies to both commit and pull request automation. Pull request automation is scaffolded but delivered by the follow-on AUTO-PR project.

## Quick Start

1. **Configure once**: Run `configure-system` or the installer to set `auto_commit` in `orchestration.yml`.
2. **Set up per project**: `rad-execute-parallel` asks (or applies) your source control preference before launching execution.
3. **Work normally**: Every approved task is committed and pushed automatically when `auto_commit: always`.

## Configuration

```yaml
# ─── Source Control ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
source_control:
  auto_commit: "ask"          # always | ask | never
  auto_pr: "ask"              # always | ask | never
  provider: "github"          # reserved: github only in v1
```

| Field | Allowed values | Default | Description |
|-------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| `auto_commit` | `always` \| `ask` \| `never` | `ask` | Controls automatic git commit after task approval |
| `auto_pr` | `always` \| `ask` \| `never` | `ask` | Controls automatic PR creation on final approval |
| `provider` | `github` | `github` | Reserved; only GitHub supported in v1 |

Per-project values persisted via `source_control_init` take precedence over these defaults at runtime.

## Setup

The `rad-execute-parallel` script handles source control setup immediately after worktree creation:

- After worktree creation, the setup step reads `auto_commit` and `auto_pr` from `orchestration.yml`.
- If either is `ask`, the operator is prompted to choose `always` or `never` for this project run.
- If both are `always` or `never`, no prompt is shown — config values are used directly.
- The resolved values are persisted to state via `pipeline.js --event source_control_init` with context `{ branch, base_branch, worktree_path, auto_commit, auto_pr }`.
- The `source_control_init` event is idempotent — safe to re-run without corrupting state.

## Pipeline Events

| Event | Triggered by | Action returned | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| `source_control_init` | `rad-execute-parallel` after worktree creation | *(state write only)* | Idempotent; safe to re-run |
| `task_commit_requested` | Resolver after task approved (when `auto_commit: always`) | `invoke_source_control_commit` | Skipped when `auto_commit: never` or absent |
| `task_committed` | Orchestrator after agent completes commit | *(next-task action)* | Resumes normal pipeline flow |
| `pr_requested` *(AUTO-PR)* | Resolver after final approval (when `auto_pr: always`) | `invoke_source_control_pr` | Placeholder — delivered by AUTO-PR |
| `pr_created` *(AUTO-PR)* | Orchestrator after agent creates PR | `display_complete` | Placeholder — delivered by AUTO-PR |

## Source Control Agent

The Source Control Agent is a thin router — it loads the `source-control` skill and delegates all operations to the routing table's reference documents and bundled scripts. No git logic is embedded in the agent definition.

| Mode | Trigger | Skill reference | Script |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| commit | `invoke_source_control_commit` action | `references/operations-guide.md` | `scripts/git-commit.js` |
| PR *(AUTO-PR)* | `invoke_source_control_pr` action | `references/pr-guide.md` *(stub)* | `scripts/gh-pr.js` *(stub)* |

The agent has access to `read`, `execute`, and `todo` tools only. It never uses `edit` — source files are the Coder's domain only.

| PR | `references/pr-guide.md` | `scripts/gh-pr.js` | AUTO-PR stub |

## Commit Message Format

Commit messages follow the pattern: `{prefix}({taskId}): {handoffTitle}`

The prefix is resolved from the task type or keywords in the task title:

| Task type / keywords | Conventional prefix |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Feature, addition, new capability | `feat` |
| Bug fix, error, resolve, patch | `fix` |
| Refactoring, restructure, clean up | `refactor` |
| Tests, coverage, spec | `test` |
| Documentation, README, docs | `docs` |
| Configuration, tooling, scripts, chore | `chore` |
| Default (unmatched) | `chore` |

**Examples:**

- `feat(TASK-1): Add source-control skill and routing table`
- `fix(TASK-2): Resolve null pointer in session handler`
- `test(TASK-5): Add integration tests for source_control_init event`
- `chore(TASK-7): Extend orchestration.yml with source_control block`

## Error Handling

The Source Control Agent produces structured feedback for every operation outcome:

**Success:**
```
✓  Committed:  feat(TASK-3): Add user authentication endpoint
✓  Pushed to:  origin/feature/my-project-branch
```

**Partial Failure — Commit Succeeded, Push Failed:**
```
✓  Committed:  feat(TASK-3): Add user authentication endpoint
✗  Push failed: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...': SSL certificate problem
   Error logged to project error log.
   To retry: run `git push` from the worktree at {worktreePath}
```

**Full Failure — Commit Failed:**
```
✗  Commit failed: nothing to commit, working tree clean
   Error logged to project error log.
   Pipeline will continue without committing TASK-3.
   To diagnose: run `git status` from the worktree at {worktreePath}
```

**Graceful Absence Notice:**
```
ℹ  Source control not initialized. Skipping commit for TASK-3.
   To enable auto-commit: re-run rad-execute-parallel before launching execution.
```

On any failure, the error details are written to the project error log via the `log-error` skill. The pipeline always continues — it does not stall on source control failures.

## State Schema

Source control state is stored under `pipeline.source_control` in `state.json`:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "source_control": {
      "branch": "feature/my-project-branch",
      "base_branch": "main",
      "worktree_path": "/path/to/worktree",
      "auto_commit": "always",
      "auto_pr": "never"
    }
  }
}
```

All 5 fields (`branch`, `base_branch`, `worktree_path`, `auto_commit`, `auto_pr`) are required when the sub-object is present. The sub-object itself is optional — its absence triggers graceful degradation: the pipeline skips commit steps and logs an informational notice. The `provider` field is hardcoded to `'github'` in the configuration layer (v1 constraint) and is not persisted to the state sub-object.

## What's Coming (AUTO-PR)

The AUTO-PR project will deliver full pull request automation on top of the scaffolding included here. AUTO-PR will add: PR pipeline events (`pr_requested`, `pr_created`), `gh` CLI integration for PR creation, and full content for `pr-guide.md`.

> Sections marked with *(AUTO-PR)* in the tables above will be filled in when AUTO-PR is delivered. No changes to this page's structure, the `orchestration.yml` schema, or the `rad-execute-parallel` prompt will be required.
