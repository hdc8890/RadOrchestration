# Run Tests

Execute the project's test suite and report structured results. This is an instructions-only skill with no template — it guides the agent through discovering and running tests, then reporting results.

## When to Use This Skill

- After implementing code changes that need validation
- When a task's acceptance criteria include "all tests pass"
- When the Coder Agent needs to verify test results before producing a Task Report
- When checking if prior test failures have been resolved after a corrective task

## Workflow

### Step 1: Discover the Test Runner

Find the project's test configuration:

1. Check `package.json` for `scripts.test` (Node.js projects)
2. Check for `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`
3. Check for `pytest.ini`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml` (Python projects)
4. Check for `Cargo.toml` (Rust projects)
5. Check for `go.mod` (Go projects)
6. Read `orchestration.yml` for any custom test commands

### Step 2: Run All Tests

Execute the discovered test command. Common patterns:

- **Node.js**: `npm test` or `npx jest` or `npx vitest run`
- **Python**: `pytest` or `python -m pytest`
- **Rust**: `cargo test`
- **Go**: `go test ./...`

### Step 3: Parse Results

Capture and structure the output:

- Total tests run
- Tests passing
- Tests failing (with failure details)
- Tests skipped
- Coverage percentage (if available)

### Step 4: Run Targeted Tests (if applicable)

If the task handoff specifies particular test files:

1. Run only those specific test files first
2. Then run the full suite to check for regressions

### Step 5: Report Structured Results

Format results for inclusion in a Task Report:

```
Tests: {passing}/{total} passing
Failures:
- {test name}: {error message}
Coverage: {X}% (if available)
Build: {pass/fail}
```

## Key Rules

- **Actually run the tests**: Never assume results — execute the command and parse real output
- **Report failures with details**: Include the test name, file, and error message for every failure
- **Run the full suite**: Even if only specific files were changed — check for regressions
- **Note flaky tests**: If a test passes on retry, note it as potentially flaky
- **Build must also pass**: Run the build command alongside tests — both must succeed

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| No test runner found | Check project root for config files; ask human if unclear |
| Tests timeout | Increase timeout or note as an issue in the Task Report |
| Missing dependencies | Run install command (`npm install`, `pip install`, etc.) first |
| Environment issues | Check for required env vars, database connections, or services |
