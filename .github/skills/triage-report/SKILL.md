# Triage Report

> **⚠️ Execution Authority Notice**: The decision tables in this document are **documentation-only**. The authoritative executor is `.github/orchestration/scripts/triage.js`. The script implements the exact logic described in the tables below. These tables remain for human readability and as the specification the script was built from. Agents MUST call the script — do NOT interpret these tables directly.

Triage task reports and review documents to determine the Tactical Planner's next action. This skill encodes exhaustive, deterministic decision tables — every input combination maps to exactly one action. No row requires judgment.

## Invocation Context

- **Embedded step** within Tactical Planner Mode 3 (phase-level triage) and Mode 4 (task-level triage) only
- **Never invoked standalone** — the Planner executes this skill inline during planning
- **Produces no output document** — triage writes verdict/action fields to `state.json`; the decision tables themselves are the deliverable

## Mode 4 — Task-Level Triage Read Sequence

Execute this read sequence when the Tactical Planner is in Mode 4 (Create Task Handoff), after reading the Phase Plan and Architecture but before producing the Task Handoff document.

| Step | Condition | Read | Source Path |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | ALWAYS | Task Report | `state.json → execution.phases[N].tasks[M].report_doc` |
| 2 | ONLY IF `task.review_doc` is non-null | Code Review | `state.json → execution.phases[N].tasks[M].review_doc` |

- If step 2 is skipped (no review doc), both `review_verdict` and `review_action` remain `null` — do not write them.
- If step 2 is attempted but the file at the path cannot be read, report error and halt (see Error Handling).

## Task-Level Decision Table

The Planner applies this table after completing the Mode 4 read sequence. Match the first row whose conditions are satisfied.

| # | Task Report Status | Has Deviations? | Code Review Verdict | `review_verdict` Written | `review_action` Written | Planner Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `complete` | No | `null` (no review yet) | *(skip — no review doc)* | *(skip — no review doc)* | Create next task handoff; carry any Recommendations from report into context |
| 2 | `complete` | No | `"approved"` | `"approved"` | `"advanced"` | Create next task handoff normally |
| 3 | `complete` | Yes — minor | `"approved"` | `"approved"` | `"advanced"` | Create next task handoff; surface minor deviations in context section |
| 4 | `complete` | Yes — architectural | `"approved"` | `"approved"` | `"advanced"` | Create next task handoff; include architectural deviation as carry-forward item |
| 5 | `complete` | Any | `"changes_requested"` | `"changes_requested"` | `"corrective_task_issued"` | Create corrective task handoff; inline specific issues from review Issues table |
| 6 | `complete` | Any | `"rejected"` | `"rejected"` | `"halted"` | Write halt to state.json; do NOT produce a handoff; signal Orchestrator to halt pipeline |
| 7 | `partial` | — | `null` (no review yet) | *(skip — no review doc)* | *(skip — no review doc)* | Assess severity: if minor issues → create corrective handoff; if blocking → halt |
| 8 | `partial` | — | `"changes_requested"` | `"changes_requested"` | `"corrective_task_issued"` | Create corrective handoff; merge partial-completion issues AND review issues into single handoff |
| 9 | `partial` | — | `"rejected"` | `"rejected"` | `"halted"` | Write halt to state.json; signal Orchestrator to halt |
| 10 | `failed` | — | Any or `null` | *(record if review doc exists)* | See note | If `retries < max_retries` AND `severity == "minor"` → `"corrective_task_issued"`; else → `"halted"` |
| 11 | `failed` | — | Any or `null` — critical severity | *(record if review doc exists)* | `"halted"` | Halt immediately regardless of retry budget |

### Row Clarifications

**Row 10 — failed task, non-critical severity:**
For a `failed` task with an existing review doc, write the `review_verdict` (transcribed verbatim from the review frontmatter), then apply the retry-budget check to determine `review_action`:
- If `task.retries < limits.max_retries_per_task` AND `task.severity == "minor"` → write `review_action` = `"corrective_task_issued"`
- Otherwise → write `review_action` = `"halted"`
- Critical severity always results in `"halted"` regardless of retry budget (see Row 11)

**Row 11 — failed task, critical severity:**
Critical severity means immediate halt. Do not check retry budget. Write `review_action` = `"halted"` unconditionally.

**Row 1 / Row 7 — no review doc:**
When `task.review_doc` is `null` (no Code Review exists yet), skip the verdict/action write entirely — both fields remain `null`. This is NOT a gatekeep violation because the Orchestrator's invariant requires `review_doc != null` to trigger: `review_doc != null AND review_verdict == null`. When `review_doc` is `null`, the first condition is false and the invariant is not triggered.

## Mode 3 — Phase-Level Triage Read Sequence

Execute this read sequence when the Tactical Planner is in Mode 3 (Create Phase Plan), after reading the Master Plan and Architecture but before producing the Phase Plan document.

| Step | Condition | Read | Source Path |
|------|-----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | ALWAYS (skip if first phase) | Phase Report | `state.json → execution.phases[N].phase_report` |
| 2 | ONLY IF `phase.phase_review` is non-null | Phase Review | `state.json → execution.phases[N].phase_review` |

- If step 1 is skipped (first phase — no previous Phase Report), proceed directly to Phase Plan creation without triage.
- If step 2 is skipped (no phase review doc), both `phase_review_verdict` and `phase_review_action` remain `null` — do not write them.
- If step 2 is attempted but the file at the path cannot be read, report error and halt (see Error Handling).

## Phase-Level Decision Table

The Planner applies this table after completing the Mode 3 read sequence. Match the first row whose conditions are satisfied.

| # | Phase Review Verdict | Exit Criteria Assessment | `phase_review_verdict` Written | `phase_review_action` Written | Planner Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `null` (no phase review yet) | — | *(skip — no review doc)* | *(skip — no review doc)* | Skip phase triage; proceed with phase planning using Phase Report only |
| 2 | `"approved"` | All exit criteria met | `"approved"` | `"advanced"` | Proceed to plan next phase normally |
| 3 | `"approved"` | Some exit criteria unmet | `"approved"` | `"advanced"` | Plan next phase; surface unmet criteria as explicit carry-forward tasks in Phase Plan |
| 4 | `"changes_requested"` | — | `"changes_requested"` | `"corrective_tasks_issued"` | Create corrective task(s) targeting integration issues from review; include review's Cross-Task Issues table in handoff context |
| 5 | `"rejected"` | — | `"rejected"` | `"halted"` | Write halt to state.json; do NOT produce a Phase Plan; signal Orchestrator to halt pipeline |

> **Note:** `phase_review_action` uses `"corrective_tasks_issued"` (plural) — a phase review can result in multiple corrective tasks. This is intentionally different from task-level `review_action` which uses `"corrective_task_issued"` (singular). Do NOT normalize these values.

## State Write Contract

The Tactical Planner is the **sole writer** of all triage fields in `state.json`. No other agent may write these fields.

### Task-Level Fields

After executing the task-level decision table, write to `state.json → execution.phases[N].tasks[M]`:

| Field | Value Source | Allowed Values |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `review_verdict` | Verbatim from Code Review frontmatter `verdict` field | `"approved"` \| `"changes_requested"` \| `"rejected"` \| `null` |
| `review_action` | Resolved from task-level decision table | `"advanced"` \| `"corrective_task_issued"` \| `"halted"` \| `null` |

### Phase-Level Fields

After executing the phase-level decision table, write to `state.json → execution.phases[N]`:

| Field | Value Source | Allowed Values |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `phase_review_verdict` | Verbatim from Phase Review frontmatter `verdict` field | `"approved"` \| `"changes_requested"` \| `"rejected"` \| `null` |
| `phase_review_action` | Resolved from phase-level decision table | `"advanced"` \| `"corrective_tasks_issued"` \| `"halted"` \| `null` |

### Verbatim Transcription Rule

`review_verdict` and `phase_review_verdict` values MUST be copied exactly from the Reviewer's frontmatter `verdict` field. The allowed values are:
- `"approved"`
- `"changes_requested"`
- `"rejected"`

**No casing normalization.** Do not convert to uppercase, lowercase, or title case.
**No mapping.** Do not translate verdict values (e.g., do not map `"changes_requested"` to `"needs_changes"`).
**No invention.** If the frontmatter `verdict` field contains a value not in the allowed set, report an error and halt (see Error Handling).

### Write Ordering

Verdict and action fields MUST be written to `state.json` BEFORE `task.handoff_doc` (when creating a task handoff) or before the Phase Plan entry (when creating a phase plan). The Planner must never write `handoff_doc` without first writing `review_verdict` and `review_action` when `review_doc` is non-null.

Correct order:
1. Write `review_verdict` and `review_action` (or `phase_review_verdict` and `phase_review_action`)
2. Write `handoff_doc` (or create Phase Plan entry)

### Immutability

Once written, verdict and action fields for a specific task or phase MUST NOT be overwritten by triage of a different task or phase. Each task's triage fields are indexed by `task_number` — the Planner writes to the specific task entry matching the task being triaged. Each phase's triage fields are indexed by `phase_number`.

## Error Handling

### Review Document Not Found

If the review document at the path stored in `state.json` cannot be read (file does not exist or is unreadable):
- Report error: `"review document not found at '{path}'"`
- Write the error to `state.json → errors.active_blockers`
- Halt the pipeline — do NOT skip triage silently
- Do NOT write verdict/action fields — leave them as `null`

### Invalid Verdict Value

If the `verdict` field in the review document's frontmatter contains a value not in the allowed enum set (`"approved"`, `"changes_requested"`, `"rejected"`):
- Report error: `"invalid verdict value '{value}' in review frontmatter at '{path}' — allowed values: approved, changes_requested, rejected"`
- Write the error to `state.json → errors.active_blockers`
- Halt the pipeline — do NOT proceed with triage
- Do NOT write verdict/action fields — leave them as `null`
