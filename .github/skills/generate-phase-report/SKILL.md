# Generate Phase Report

Generate a Phase Report after all tasks in a phase are complete. Summarizes phase outcomes, assesses exit criteria, and feeds into the next phase planning cycle.

## When to Use This Skill

- After all tasks in a phase have been completed and reviewed
- When the Orchestrator spawns the Tactical Planner to summarize a phase
- When determining carry-forward items for the next phase

## Inputs Required

| Input | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase Plan | `{NAME}-PHASE-{NN}-{TITLE}.md` | Task outline, exit criteria |
| Task Reports | `{NAME}-TASK-REPORT-P{NN}-T{NN}.md` (all) | Per-task results, files changed, issues |
| Code Reviews | `CODE-REVIEW-P{NN}-T{NN}.md` (all) | Per-task review verdicts |
| State | `state.json` | Retry counts, error aggregation |

## Workflow

1. **Read all inputs**: Load Phase Plan, all Task Reports, all Code Reviews, state.json
2. **Summarize**: 2-3 sentences on what was accomplished
3. **Aggregate task results**: Table with task status, retry count, key outcome per task
4. **Assess exit criteria**: Go through each criterion from the Phase Plan, mark as Met/Not Met
5. **Aggregate files changed**: Total files created/modified across all tasks
6. **Document issues**: Compile all issues from Task Reports with resolutions
7. **Identify carry-forward items**: Anything the next phase must address
8. **Recommend adjustments**: If phase outcomes suggest the Master Plan needs adjustment
9. **Write the Phase Report**: Use the bundled template at [templates/PHASE-REPORT.md](./templates/PHASE-REPORT.md)
10. **Save**: Write to `{PROJECT-DIR}/reports/{NAME}-PHASE-REPORT-P{NN}.md`

## Key Rules

- **Factual aggregation**: No opinions — compile data from task reports
- **Every task accounted for**: All tasks from the Phase Plan appear in the results table
- **Exit criteria are from the Phase Plan**: Mirror them exactly and verify each one
- **Carry-forward items are concrete**: Specific things the next phase must handle, not vague concerns

## Template

Use the bundled template: [PHASE-REPORT.md](./templates/PHASE-REPORT.md)
