# Review Code

Perform a structured code review after a coding task. Evaluate code quality, architectural consistency, design adherence, test coverage, error handling, accessibility, and security.

## When to Use This Skill

- After a Coder completes a task and produces a Task Report
- When the Orchestrator spawns the Reviewer Agent to validate a task
- When assessing whether code changes meet the plan's requirements

## Inputs Required

| Input | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Task Report | `{NAME}-TASK-REPORT-P{NN}-T{NN}.md` | Files changed, tests, acceptance criteria results |
| Task Handoff | `{NAME}-TASK-P{NN}-T{NN}-{TITLE}.md` | Original task requirements, contracts, acceptance criteria |
| Architecture | `{NAME}-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Contracts, module map, file structure |
| Design | `{NAME}-DESIGN.md` | Components, design tokens, accessibility |
| PRD | `{NAME}-PRD.md` | Requirements being validated |
| Source Code | Actual files listed in Task Report | The code to review |

## Workflow

1. **Read the Task Handoff**: Understand what was supposed to be built
2. **Read the Task Report**: Understand what was actually built — files, tests, issues
3. **Read the source code**: Review every file listed in the Task Report's Files Changed table
4. **Check architectural consistency**: Do modules follow the Architecture's module map? Are contracts honored?
5. **Check design consistency**: Do components match the Design's specs? Are design tokens correct?
6. **Assess code quality**: Clean code, proper naming, no dead code, appropriate abstractions
7. **Verify test coverage**: Are the required tests present and meaningful?
8. **Check error handling**: Proper error boundaries, edge cases handled
9. **Check accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
10. **Check security**: No exposed secrets, proper input validation, auth checks
11. **Determine verdict**: approved, changes_requested, or rejected
12. **Write the Code Review**: Use the bundled template at [templates/CODE-REVIEW.md](./templates/CODE-REVIEW.md)
13. **Save**: Write to `{PROJECT-DIR}/reports/CODE-REVIEW-P{NN}-T{NN}.md`

## Verdict Rules

| Verdict | When | Planner Action |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `approved` | All checklist items ✅ or ⚠️ with no critical issues | Mark task complete |
| `changes_requested` | Minor issues that need fixing | Generate corrective task |
| `rejected` | Critical issues, architectural violations, security problems | Halt or escalate |

## Key Rules

- **Read the actual code**: Don't just trust the Task Report — inspect the source files
- **Binary assessments**: Each checklist item is ✅ (good), ⚠️ (minor concern), or ❌ (needs fixing)
- **Issues have suggestions**: Every issue found must include a concrete fix suggestion
- **Severity matters**: minor issues trigger retries; critical issues halt the pipeline

## Template

Use the bundled template: [CODE-REVIEW.md](./templates/CODE-REVIEW.md)
