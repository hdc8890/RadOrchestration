# Cross-Agent File Dependency Map

> Defines exactly which agents read and write which documents. This is the contract that prevents conflicts and ensures agents have the context they need.

                         Orchestrator reads state.json → decides next action
```

---

## Key Rules

1. **Only the Tactical Planner writes state files** (state.json, STATUS.md)
2. **The Coder reads ONLY the TASK-HANDOFF** — nothing else. Self-contained.
3. **The Orchestrator reads ONLY state.json + STATUS.md** — never reads planning docs directly
4. **Each planning agent reads all prior planning docs** — Research reads Idea, PM reads Research+Idea, etc.
5. **The Reviewer reads planning docs + reports** — validates code against the plan
6. **No agent reads another agent's working state** — they communicate through documents only

## File Ownership (Sole Writer)

| Document | Sole Writer |
|----------|-------------|
| `state.json` | Tactical Planner |
| `STATUS.md` | Tactical Planner |
| `RESEARCH-FINDINGS.md` | Research Agent |
| `PRD.md` | Product Manager Agent |
| `DESIGN.md` | UX Designer Agent |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architect Agent |
| `MASTER-PLAN.md` | Architect Agent |
| `PHASE-PLAN.md` | Tactical Planner |
| `TASK-HANDOFF.md` | Tactical Planner |
| `TASK-REPORT.md` | Coder Agent |
| `CODE-REVIEW.md` | Reviewer Agent |
| `PHASE-REPORT.md` | Tactical Planner |
| `PHASE-REVIEW.md` | Reviewer Agent |

Every document has exactly ONE writer. No conflicts by design.
